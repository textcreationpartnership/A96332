            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>This Diſcourſe plainly overthrows all the Foundations of the Romiſh Faith, ſhewing 1. That the Romiſh Councils and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot be the ſole authentick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of Scripture, or the true Judges of Tradition, §. 1. <hi>2ly.</hi> That they were not aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Decree touching Communion in one King, §. 2. <hi>3ly.</hi> That the Councils of <hi>Conſtance, Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> were not true General Councils, or that ſuch Councils muſt be ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Error, §. 3. <hi>4ly.</hi> That there is no Certainty of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Faith by oral Tradition, §. 4. <hi>5ly.</hi> That theſe Councils ridiculouſly do aſſert, That they made their Decrees touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communion in one King conſulting the Advantage and Salvation of Chriſtian People, §. 5. <hi>6ly.</hi> That the Decrees of the Councils of <hi>Piſa, Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> concerning the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of a Genral Council over the Pope, and their Authority to decree matters of Faith without him, muſt be allowed to be valid, or we can have no Aſſurance of the Validity and Infallibility of any of their Councils, §. 6.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>BY way of Preface to this Diſcourſe I ſhall endeavour briefly, and plainly to demonſtrate,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it plainly overthroweth all the Certainty of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Faith, and that if they have made theſe</hi> Definitions <hi>and</hi> Decrees <hi>in oppoſition to the plain Sence of</hi> Scripture, <hi>and the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:153754:3"/>of it by the Holy</hi> Fathers, <hi>and to the full Tradition of the</hi> Church <hi>in former Ages, theſe their received</hi> Councils <hi>cannot be by Gods Appointment, the</hi> Judges <hi>of our</hi> Controverſies, <hi>the</hi> authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Interpreters of Scripture, <hi>or aſſiſted by the</hi> Holy Ghoſt <hi>in making theſe Deciſions, nor can they be Aſſertors of, or Adherers to</hi> primitive Tradition, <hi>but rather plain Deſertors of it.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Firſt, <hi>is, That though the</hi> Ancients <hi>alledged here, directly oppoſe the Doctrines and Determinations of theſe</hi> Councils, <hi>and the Practice of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>eſtabliſhed by them; yet do I not for that Reaſon only conclude her guilty of Sin and Error in denying the Cup to the Laity, for I am far from holding every thing taught or practiſed by the</hi> Ancients, <hi>as certainly true and neceſſary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear not any Retortions of this Nature, from our</hi> Adverſaries: <hi>Had I deſigned any thing of that Nature, I would more cpiouſly have inſisted on thoſe Arguments from Scripture, whence that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion can alone be made, and which I therefore have ſo briefly touched
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:153754:8"/>upon, becauſe I was ſo happily prevented in that matter by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Treatiſe on this Subject againſt the Biſhop of</hi> Meaux, <hi>with which I was unwilling to interfere; but finding that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned</hi> Biſhop <hi>had with great confidence appealed for this matter, to the</hi> conſtant practice <hi>and to the</hi> Principles <hi>of the</hi> Primitive Church,<note place="margin">P. 160, 161.</note> 
               <hi>and told us, That</hi> the conſtant Practices of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church received with univerſal approbation from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of Chriſtianity, till the time of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> do invincibly demonſtrate, that the Council did but follow the <hi>Tradition of All Ages</hi> when it defined, That the Communion under one kind was as good and ſufficient as under both, <hi>with many other things of a like nature, in which he is alſo followed by the late Writers of the ſame Communion: And finding alſo that the once exploded</hi> Blackloiſts <hi>were again admitted to plead the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the</hi> Roman Church <hi>from</hi> practical Tradition, <hi>and that this was done upon the ſtrength of theſe two Propoſitions:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">J. S.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath always held cloſe to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and received ſtill her Doctrine by Tradition from the Father to the Son, from the firſt to the ſecond, and ſo to the preſent Age.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That</hi> ſhe could not miſtake the ſenſe of Tradition in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points. <hi>In contradiction to theſe confident Aſſertions I have here ſhewed, by confronting the Doctrines and Sayings of the</hi> Fathers, <hi>to the expreſs Determinations of their</hi> Councils.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the preſent</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>hath varied in this matter from</hi> Antiquity, <hi>both in Doctrine and Practice, and that</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>plainly contradicts all their Aſſertions and Decrees relating to it: And therefore that all her late</hi> Defenders <hi>are much miſtaken, or, which is worſe, would lead others into a known Error, when they undertake to perſwade them that the practice of their</hi> Church, <hi>in denying the Cup to the</hi> Laity <hi>and to</hi> Prieſts non-conficient, <hi>is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Tradition and Primitive Practice, and by the</hi> Principles <hi>on which they builded that pretended Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That in this</hi> particular Point <hi>ſhe hath either actually miſtaken the Sence of</hi> Tradition, <hi>or actually devidated from</hi> Tradition. <hi>And ſeeing whether ſhe does not differ from or agree with the</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Belief, and Practice in this</hi> Article, <hi>is a matter of</hi> Fact, <hi>and ſo may be determined by the Teſtimony of good</hi> Witneſſes <hi>of what was practiſed and believed in their Times, and by plain Allegations of matter of</hi> Fact, <hi>without</hi> Infallibility: <hi>In plain reaſon, and from
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:153754:8"/>her own avowed Principles it follows, that her Authority in ſaying ſhe does not differ from the</hi> Tradition <hi>of the</hi> Ancients, <hi>and much more in aſſerting, That ſhe hath always held to it, and therefore could not miſtake the Sence of it, can be of no force againſt plain evidence of</hi> Fact <hi>to the contrary. If then the difference betwixt the Belief and Practice of the</hi> Ancients, <hi>and of the</hi> preſent Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>in this matter be evident, as I think I have made it, it muſt be owned that the preſent received Tradition of that</hi> Church <hi>can be no certain Rule of Truth, and no ſure Argument that ſuch was the Tradition of the</hi> Primitive Church, <hi>ſince in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ſhe hath actually varied from the Tradition of the</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus far,</hi> 1. <hi>and no farther, would I be thought to drive the Argument drawn from the Citations of the</hi> Ancients. <hi>The Right or</hi> Authority <hi>claimed by that</hi> Church, <hi>will be beſt judged of by other</hi> Intrinſick Arguments, <hi>which ought to have the greater force when it appears that</hi> Preſcription <hi>is againſt our</hi> Adverſaries. <hi>Only I cannot but admire why the</hi> Trent Council <hi>ſhould found their Power of making ſuch a Change in our</hi> Lord<hi>'s Inſtitution, on thoſe words of the</hi> Apoſlte, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 1<note n="(t)" place="margin">Id autem Apoſtolus non obſcure viſus eſt innuiſſe cum ait, ſic nos exiſtimet, <hi>&amp;c.

               <hi>the Bleſſed Apoſtles in their Goſpels had delivered that Chriſt commanded them to do ſo;</hi> for, <hi>be having taken Bread, and given thanks, is by them declared to have ſaid, Do this in remembrance of me, this is my Body; and alſo when he had taken the Cup, and given thanks, to have ſaid This is my Blood, and to have given it to them alone.</hi> Where note firſt, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſpeaks here of a <hi>command</hi> of Chriſt, which cannot poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto the <hi>conſecration,</hi> but to the <hi>participation</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the command being, <hi>Do this, Take, eat, Drink ye all of this.</hi> Secondly, he had ſaid before that, <hi>only</hi>

            <p>Where evident it is that the Practice of the <hi>Manichees</hi> in Receiving of the Body of the Lord in the <hi>Chriſtian Myſteries,</hi> that ſo they might diſſemble their Infidelity, is called <hi>Simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and their declining to <hi>drink the Blood of our Redemption,</hi> is that which made this <hi>Simulation</hi> to be <hi>Sacrilegious. 2dly.</hi> Here it is alſo evident, that in <hi>St. Leo</hi>'s days, to eat the Body of our Lord, or to receive it, and to drink his Blood, were look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as two diſtinct things, one of which might be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, the Body being taken when the <hi>Blood of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was not,</hi> which wholly overthrows the Doctrine of <hi>Concomitance,</hi> on which this <hi>Sacrilege</hi> is founded. <hi>3ly.</hi> Obſerve that <hi>Leo</hi> would have ſuch perſons expelled from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints for this <hi>Sacrilegious Simulation.</hi> That <hi>4ly.</hi> He makes the declining of the Cup at any time, a mark ſufficient to diſcern theſe <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> Perſons, and a cauſe ſufficient for their Excluſion from the Communion of <hi>Saints;</hi> whereas had others at any time been permitted in the <hi>Church</hi>-Aſſemblies to Communicate in Bread alone, for any other Reaſon, this mark had been no certain indication of a <hi>Manichee</hi> to <hi>Prieſt</hi> or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſince being caught, they might pretend that they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received the <hi>Cup,</hi> but now abſtained for ſome ſpecial cauſe approved by the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Faithful</hi> therefore muſt have then generally Communicated at all times, or elſe the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee</hi> could not be certainly diſcovered by one <hi>Dry Communion.</hi>

               <hi>Algerus</hi> in the <hi>Twelfth Century</hi> cites this <hi>Decree</hi> to prove that the Bread is ſeparately to be conſecrated into the Fleſh, and the Wine into the Blood of Chriſt, and that both are to be received by the Faithful.

This Novelty apparently deſtroys the energy of the words uſed in the Inſtitution of this Sacred Ordinance, in which our <hi>Lord,</hi> when he had given his Body broken to his own <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and they had actually received it, ſaith of the following Cup, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. xxvi. 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>for this is the blood of the New-Teſtament ſhed for you.</hi> Whereas if he knew any thing of this <hi>Concomitance,</hi> he muſt know alſo they had received this <hi>blood of the New-Teſtament</hi> already, and therefore might have ſpared his Cup and Reaſon both. <hi>This do as oft as you drink it</hi> came too late, for they had done what he commanded, in effect, before he bid them do it.<note place="margin">Seſſ. 13. c. 3.</note>

Why did he bleſs the Cup, and bleſſing ſaid, with like Solemnity, and with expreſs injunction, Drink ye all of this? Or why did he permit his <hi>Church</hi> for a whole Thouſand Years to give his Members, a thing which might be oft of a pernicious influence to them who did receive it unworthily, but could be of no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual advantage to them who did receive it worthily; ſince after we have taken worthily the conſecrated Body, we have taken as much as when we have received the Blood alſo?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Condom</hi> ſets down this as their Principle,<note place="margin">Treat. of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both Kinds, <hi>p. 327.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That he who hath received the Bread of Life,</hi> has no need of receiving the ſacred Blood, <hi>ſeeing he has received, together with the Bread of Life, the whole Subſtance of the Sacrament, and together with that Subſtance, the whole eſſential virtue of the Euchariſt.</hi> Now from this Principle it follows with the cleareſt evidence, that it was needleſs for our <hi>Saviour</hi> to have ſaid to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> after they had received the Bread of Life, <hi>Drink ye all of this</hi> Cup. That his Inſtitution of the Cup to be received after the Bread of Life, was a <hi>needleſs Inſtitution,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> was imployed in a <hi>needleſs</hi> Action for a Thouſand Years, when ſhe diſtributed the Cup to all Believers. That when our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of this, for this is my Blood of the New-Teſtament which is ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> he gave a <hi>needleſs</hi> reaſon of a <hi>needleſs</hi> Action, exhorting them to do what they had whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done already, to the end here aſſigned by him of the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. And can that Principle be true which caſts ſuch horrid Imputations on the Commands, the Inſtitution, and the Reaſon of that Inſtitution aſſigned by our <hi>Bleſſed Lord,</hi> and on the conſtant Practice of the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed this new <hi>Capricio</hi> of <hi>Concomitance</hi> cannot well be thought of by a <hi>Roman Doctor,</hi> but preſently this Queſtion ſtares him in the Face, <hi>To what purpoſe then was the Inſtitution of both Species?</hi> they being conſcious to themſelves that the very natural, and obvious Concluſion from it would be this, That our Lord's Inſtitution of both Species was to no purpoſe; they therefore have invented a new Reaſon of the neceſſity of Conſecrating both the Species apart,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Condom, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 179, 180.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion once made upon the Croſs of our Lord's Body and Blood, might never ceaſe</hi> to appear on the Holy Table. Now is it not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſtabliſh a continual repreſentation
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:153754:43"/>of the ſeparation of his Blood from his Body by Species, which he commands us to believe, contain his Body and his Blood united. What a pretty Myſtery do theſe Men make of the ſacred Inſtitution of our <hi>Lord.</hi> Bread and Wine never ceaſe to appear unto our Senſes, and yet we muſt not believe this Appearance, but by Faith believe there is no ſuch thing; the ſame Faith teacheth me, that our <hi>Lord</hi>'s Body and Blood are united there, and yet I muſt believe our <hi>Lord</hi> deſigned the continual repreſentation of them there as ſeparate, where Faith informs me there is no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Doctrine of Concomitance ſeems even to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s words, and make them run to this effect; I ſay unto you, <hi>This is my Body broken,</hi> not by way of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation only, but ſubſtantially ſo; and yet I know my Body neither is ſubſtantially broken in this Sacrament, nor can it ever be ſo. I bid you take this Cup, and to encourage you to do ſo, I ſay, <hi>This is my Blood ſhed,</hi> or ſeparated from my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and yet I know that there is always in this Sacrament ſuch a <hi>Concomitance,</hi> as renders it impoſſible my Blood ſhould be thus ſeparated as I ſay it is. But notwithſtanding I inſtitute a Myſtery, which by ſome broken Accidents of Bread anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, or ſome few colours or bare Species of Wine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſubject, ſhall give ſome faint reſemblance of my Body broken, and my Blood ſhed for you: This is my broken Body; that is, under theſe broken Accidents of Bread lyeth my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whole, and united to my Blood, and therefore not my Body broken for you. This is my Blood, ſhed for you; that is, under this empty ſhew of Wine lieth my Blood united to my Body, and ſo my Blood not ſhed; and whether <hi>hoc eſt corpus,</hi> thus interpreted, doth not make Nonſence of the words, let the conſiderate Reader judge.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If there be ſuch a neceſſary Concomitance in the Sacrament, then muſt each part of the Sacrament exhibit whole and entire <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with all his Benefits, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the depriving the <hi>Laity</hi> of one part, or Species of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, muſt be the depriving them of whole <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all his benefits. Now then in doing this, either they are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of ſome ſpiritual Benefit, or not; if the firſt, then muſt the <hi>Romaniſts be Sacrilegious,</hi> becauſe they do deprive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:153754:44"/>of ſome ſpiritual Benefit from thoſe ſacred Myſteries they formerly received, and that agreeably unto the Inſtitution of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and the common practice of the <hi>Church</hi> for a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years. If the receiving of the <hi>Chalice</hi> worthily be of any advantage to Souls, then he, who does not receive it, is a looſer; and he by whom they are deprived of this ſpiritual Good muſt be a <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> perſon. If it be ſaid that no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Benefit can accrue to them by drinking of the Cup, then muſt it be aſſerted that albeit a Man receive entire <hi>Chriſt</hi> worthily, yet may he never be the better for it, and what is this but to <hi>eſteem the Blood of the Covenant</hi> thus received <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing.</hi>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> had our <hi>Lord</hi> taught Concomitance, his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament had been the Inſtitution of a thing direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Law of <hi>Moſes, viz.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> To conclude, ſhould we admit of this imagination, it would not free the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> from the Imputation of an half Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it would from delivering of half Chriſt. For feeing a Sacrament is <hi>an outward viſible ſign,</hi> it follows evidently, he who hath but half of the outward viſible ſigns, hath but half of the Sacrament, and conſequently an half Sacrament. He that receives only the Bread, receives only the Sacrament of the Body, and not the Sacrament of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo receives not an entire Sacrament.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,That Chriſt's Inſtitution of this Sacrament is virtually a Command, obliging all the Faithful, as much as in them lieth, to receive both kinds,</hi> will be apparent from theſe following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Lord ſaid in the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, <hi>Drink ye All of this.</hi> For whereas <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid only, <hi>Drink ye all of this, to them, to whom he ſaid, when ſpeaking of the Bread, Do this;</hi> and that thoſe words were only ſpoken to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whom he then made <hi>Prieſts.</hi> To
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:153754:49"/>this I anſwer, That we have clear and convincing Evidence that theſe words, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> are to be applied to others beſides the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> As V. Gr. 1. From <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, whence I argue thus, <hi>Chriſt</hi> Inſtituted no other Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, than that which he adminiſtred to his <hi>Diſciples;</hi> if then he did not inſtitute that for <hi>all Believers</hi> capable, they have no right to any part of it, by virtue of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution; it can be unto them no Sacrament, for whom it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſince, by the definition of the<note n="*" place="margin">Seſſ. 7. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> the Sacraments of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were <hi>all inſtituted by him;</hi> they can expect no bleſſing from it, ſince that depends upon <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Ordinance; nay they muſt be eſteemed <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> as laying claim to that Sacrament which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution did belong unto them. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> did Inſtitute that Sacrament for all Believers capable, that is, to be a ſtanding Ordinance by which, as his <hi>Diſciples</hi> then did, ſo all Believers capable, ſhould afterwards eat of what he called his Body, and drink of what he called his Blood, then did he Inſtitute it to be received of all that were fitted for, and capable to receive it, and in it ſaid unto them, <hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This appears farther from the Reaſon annexed to the Receiving of the Sacrament by <hi>Chriſt's Apoſtles;</hi> for ſince that Reaſon equally concerns all <hi>Believers</hi> capable, and fitted to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, the Inſtitution muſt concern them all. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to his <hi>Apoſtles, Take, and eat</hi> what I have <hi>broken,</hi> is by himſelf declared to be this; becauſe it was <hi>his Body broken,</hi> or his <hi>Body given</hi> for them; take it, ſaith <hi>Chriſt, this is my Body given for you;</hi> this therefore being the Reaſon why they were to take, and eat, and this Reaſon concerning all Believers capable, and fitted to receive it, as much as the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſucceeding <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the Inſtitution, or command to take and eat muſt equally concern them. This Argument transferred unto the <hi>Cup</hi> runs thus: The Reaſon of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating of the <hi>Cup, viz.</hi> becauſe <hi>it is the Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> doth concern <hi>Laicks</hi> as well as <hi>Prieſts,</hi> his Blood being equally ſhed for both; therefore the Command, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> to which the Reaſon is annexed, concerns them alſo. Again, another Reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to his <hi>Apoſtles, Eat this Bread, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:153754:50"/>drink this Cup,</hi> was, that by ſo doing they might <hi>remember his death,</hi> his Body broken, and his blood ſhed for them, ſaith St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>ſhew it forth</hi> till his ſecond coming, ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Now this, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly ſhews in his diſcourſe to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and all the World believes, as well concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Believers as it doth <hi>Prieſts;</hi> and therefore the drinking of the Cup, by which, as well as eating of the Bread, this Commemoration is by our <hi>Lord</hi>'s Inſtitution to be made, muſt equally concern them.</p>
            <p>A Second Argument to prove that <hi>Lay</hi>-men, by virtue of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, have a right to, and are obliged to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Cup of Bleſſing, is taken from theſe words of the Evangeliſt St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> xiv. 23.</note> 
               <hi>And taking the Cup, giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank of it;</hi> For here the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi> informs us, That <hi>All the Apoſtles</hi> drank of this Cup, and I preſume, they did it, becauſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> gave it to them for that end, for to what other end it ſhould be given them the <hi>Roman Doctors</hi> have not yet inform'd us. Now hence it follows, that <hi>Lay</hi>-men alſo have a right to be partakers of the Cup; for the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were then <hi>Lay</hi>-men; they being afterwards made <hi>Prieſts</hi> by our Lord's ſaying,<note place="margin">Joh. xx. 22.</note> after his Reſurrection, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you, receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Joh. vij. 39.</note> 
               <hi>The Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Jeſus was not glorified, or riſen from the dead.</hi> I know the <hi>Roman Doctors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Syn. Trid. Seſſ. 22. cap. 1.</note> and <hi>J. L.</hi> from the <hi>Trent Council</hi> teach, That the <hi>Apoſtles were made Prieſts when Chriſt ſaid, Do this:</hi> and that then he gave them the <hi>Chalice,</hi> as Repreſentatives of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> not of the People. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let it be conſidered how unlikely it is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould at one time inſtitute Two Sacraments, as they eſteem them, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and yet ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Uſe or the Reaſon, or the Benefit or the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of one of them, nor tell them that he did ſo, nor expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Myſtery, nor diſtinguiſh the Rite, or the Words, (though the nature of theſe Sacraments, being ſo extreamly different, required theſe things) but that he ſhould leave all this to be ſuppoſed by the moſt improbable conſtruction in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were made <hi>Prieſts</hi> by, <hi>Hoc facite, Do this,</hi> ſpoken before the Inſtitution of the <hi>Chalice,</hi> then muſt <hi>Judas</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:153754:50"/>alſo be made a <hi>Prieſt</hi> by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for that he alſo did receive the Sacrament, is extreamly evident from theſe words of <hi>Luke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. xxij. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood — but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the Table.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were made <hi>Prieſts</hi> by our <hi>Lord</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Do this,</hi> then were they doubly Conſecrated, and the <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi> of <hi>Prieſts</hi> was twice imprinted on them, which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the common tenet of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that <hi>the Sacrament of Orders is not to be reiterated;</hi> and the peculiar Tenet of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 7. Can. 9.</note> That <hi>Sacraments which impreſs a Character muſt not be reiterated.</hi> The reaſon of the Conſequence is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> witneſſes, our Lord ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xi. 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Do this,</hi> both after the giving of the Bread, and after the giving of the Cup.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Had the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> been made <hi>Prieſts</hi> by our Lord's ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words to them, yet being not <hi>Conficients,</hi> they had no right to receive it as <hi>Prieſts,</hi> more than the <hi>Laity;</hi> for the fore-mentioned <hi>Councils</hi> have determined, That <hi>Clerks being not Conficients, are by no Divine Right obliged to Receive under both Species.</hi> There being then no difference betwixt them and the <hi>Laity,</hi> in reference to this matter, ſince <hi>All the Apoſtles</hi> drank of this Cup, why ſhould not the Laity do ſo too?</p>
            <p>A Third Argument to prove that Lay-men, by virtue of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, are obliged to receive the Cup of Bleſſing, is taken from the Recapitulation of our Lord's Inſtitution by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who doth expreſly teach us, That <hi>our Lord Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. xi. 25.</note> 
               <hi>in the ſame Night in which he was betrayed, took the Cup, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood; this do ye, as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me.</hi> Now in the Three <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> no ſuch words are expreſsly to be found; nor any thing like them ſpoken at the diſtribution of the Cup, unleſs theſe words, <hi>Drink ye all of this, for this is my Blood of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that is ſhed for many, for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> be of like import with the words of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth expreſly teach, That our <hi>Lord</hi> uſed theſe words at his laſt Supper, and that he received them from the <hi>Lord,</hi> as words which he had ſpoken, then what remains, but they virtually are the ſame with thoſe recorded by St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> and then they muſt alſo be a Command obliging all to drink
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:153754:51"/>of this Cup, as being the Memorial of the Blood of the New Teſtament ſhed for them, and therefore to be drunk by all, in the remembrance of the Blood ſhed for them, as often as they did preſent themſelves to Celebrate that <hi>Holy Myſtery.</hi> I ſay, obliging all that are capable, when they preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, to Celebrate the memory of his precious Death, and his Blood ſhed for their Redemption, to drink of that Cup, which is the Memorial and Symbol of his Blood ſhed for them. For ſure, the means which <hi>Chriſt</hi> appointed for ſuch an end, ought to be uſed by all who are obliged to purſue that end: Since therefore all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are obliged Sacramentally to remember, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhed his Blood for them, and by that Blood ſhed, confirmed the <hi>New Covenant</hi> to them; and ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appointed the drinking of this Cup and this alone, to be the memorial of his Blood ſhed, all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> capable of doing ſo, muſt be obliged, when they do Sacramentally Commemorate theſe Mercies, to drink of this Cup. And this demonſtratively follows from the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>26</label> 
               <hi>Do this, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me;for as often as you eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, you ſhew the Lord's death till he come;</hi> for they do manifeſt, that as well by drinking of the Cup, as eating of the Bread the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Death is ſhewed, and that until his ſecond coming, both theſe things are to be done in order to that end: And ſince theſe words are not the words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſpeaks here of the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth;</hi> the words preceeding, <hi>Do this, as oft as you ſhall drink it, in remembrance of me,</hi> muſt belong alſo to all the Members of that <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe of the connective Particle which joins the <hi>25th</hi> and <hi>26th</hi> Verſes, and makes it neceſſary that the ſame perſons ſhould be ſpoken to in the words. <hi>This do,</hi> &amp;c. and in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup.</hi> And if this was the Duty of the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> it muſt be equally the Duty of the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there being no peculiar reaſon why the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> ſhould be obliged to drink this Cup, in order to theſe ends, more than all other <hi>Chriſtian Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when our <hi>Lord</hi> hath taken ſo great Care to tell us, That the Bread is <hi>his broken Body,</hi> and therefore is to be eaten in remembrance of him, <hi>i. e.</hi> of his Body broken; that the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:153754:51"/>Cup is <hi>the New-Taſtament in his Blood,</hi> and therefore is to be drank in remembrance of his Blood ſhed for us: When his <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth as diſtinctly ſay,<note place="margin">1 Cor. x. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The Bread which we break is the Communion of the Body of Chriſt, the Cup which we bleſs is the Communion of the Blood;</hi> and neither of them have hinted in the leaſt, that the Cup is the Communion of his Body, or the Bread of his Blood, but by a particular and ſeparate inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſtribution, and ſignification aſcribed to them, have ſtrogly inſinuated the contrary; for men, after all this to ſay one of theſe Species will ſuffice, for the Bread is as well the blood ſhed as the broken Body, and the participation of it is the Communion of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that by the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, we do as well remember and ſhew forth the ſhedding of his Blood upon the Croſs, as by the partaking of the Cup, is to my apprehenſion an affront offered to our dear <hi>Lord,</hi> and to the Wiſdom of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to theſe Arguments, ſome of the <hi>Roman Doctors</hi> are pleaſed to ſay, that this Diſcourſe of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> imports <hi>only a conditional Order to do this in Remembrance of Jeſus Chriſt, as often as one ſhall do it, and not an order abſolutely to do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer, <hi>1st.</hi> He who not only doth command us at the celebration of the Sacrament, to remember his Blood ſhed, but alſo Inſtitutes a ſign for the memorial of it, and doth command us to uſe this ſign, becauſe it is appointed to be the memorial of it; commands us when we receive the Sacrament, to receive that ſign, for he who wills the end, muſt will the means which he hath inſtituted for the accompliſhing that end; but this doth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for he inſtitutes a Cup of Wine to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his Blood ſhed; he ſaith, <hi>Drink ye all of this, for this is my Blood ſhed,</hi> this I command you to do in remembrance of me: He therefore doth command us when we receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive this ſign, which, in his Inſtitution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, he appointed as the means of this remembrance.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> He who commands us to drink this Cup, <hi>as oft as we drink it in remembrance of him,</hi> becauſe we do by drinking of it <hi>ſhew forth the Lords Death till he come,</hi> commands us to do it as oft as we receive the Sacrament, ſeeing as oft as we receive the Sacrament, we ſhew forth the Lord's Death; but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> did lay upon us this command for this very Reaſon, ſaying, <hi>Do this, as oft as you ſhall drink it, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:153754:52"/>of me, for as often as you ſhall eat this Bread and drink this Cup, you ſhew forth the Lord's Death till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Where there is parity of Reaſon, there the command may very well be deemed of equal latitude and extent, for <hi>ratio legis eſt lex,</hi> where there is equal reaſon to command, there may we reaſonably ſuppoſe the will of the <hi>Law-giver</hi> to be equal in commanding, but ther is equal reaſon why our <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould abſolutely command the drinking of the Cup in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Blood ſhed, as why he abſolutely ſhould ſay, touching the eating of the Bread, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> the one being as much the Symbol of his Blood ſhed, as is the other of his broken Body, and the one ſhewing forth his Death as much as doth the other; we therefore have no cauſe to doubt, but that he equally intended the doing both in order to this end.</p>

The <hi>Jews</hi> taking theſe words in a groſs ſence, as if our Lord had promiſed to give his <hi>real Fleſh to be ſwallowed down their Throats, and eaten by them as they had eaten Bread the day before,</hi> and as their fore-<hi>Fathers</hi> had eaten <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, exclaimed againſt him, as promiſing a thing abſurd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane and impoſible, ſaying, <hi>How can this Man give us his Fleſh to eat?</hi> to this our <hi>Saviour</hi> Anſwers, <hi>v.</hi> 53. in words ſtill more expreſſive of his violent and bloody Death for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind; <hi>viz. Except you eat my Fleſh, and drink my
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153754:53"/>Blood, &amp;c.</hi> Now theſe words are by ſome conceived to import thus much, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs you with the Mouth of your Bodies do eat my real and corporeal Fleſh, and drink my proper Blood, you cannot have eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having premiſed theſe Obſervations, I ſhall now proceed to ſhew both from this <hi>Chapter,</hi> and from other Reaſons, that our <hi>Lord</hi> ſpake not here of <hi>oral</hi> and <hi>corporeal</hi> eating of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fleſh, and drinking of his proper Blood, but only of doing of theſe things <hi>ſpiritually;</hi> and that not only in the celebration of that <hi>Sacrament</hi> which by our Lord was Inſtituted for the remembrance of his Death and Paſſion, but generally believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by his Death and Paſſion he became the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World, and purchaſed Pardon and Salvation for all that heartily believed in him, and would ſincerely yield Obedience to his precepts. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Againſt the groſs, and for the ſpiritual Interpretation of theſe words I argue from the 51. <hi>v.</hi> thus, The Fleſh which Chriſt here promiſed to <hi>give for the Life of the World,</hi> is the ſame with <hi>the Bread of God that cometh down from Heaven, and giveth Life unto the World, v.</hi> 33. for ſo we learn expreſly from theſe words; <hi>I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven, if any Man eat of this Bread he ſhall live for ever; and the Bread which I will give is my Fleſh, that I will give for the Life of the World.</hi> And again, having ſaid, <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh and drinketh my Blood hath eternal Life,</hi> v. 54. and <hi>he that eateth me ſhall live by me, v.</hi> 57. he adds immediately, <hi>This is the Bread which came down from Heaven — and he that eateth of this Bread ſhall live for ever.</hi> Now our Lord hath expreſly taught us, that the eating of this Bread of Life imported only our believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, <hi>v.</hi> 35. as hath already been made evident from our ſecond Obſervation; therefore the eating of his Fleſh doth certainly import the ſame ſpiritual Action. Moreover we are only to eat of <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>Fleſh,</hi> in that importance of the Phraſe in which we are to eat of Chriſt as <hi>Bread,</hi> for as Chriſt ſaith, he will give <hi>Fleſh to eat,</hi> ſo doth he ſay, he will give <hi>Bread to eat;</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>He that eateth of my Fleſh ſhall live for ever,</hi> ſo he ſaith <hi>He that eateth of this Bread ſhall live for ever;</hi> but none can ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was or could properly be Bread, or eaten by the Mouth as ſuch, wherefore he being only figuratively and ſpiritually Bread, could only figuratively and ſpiritually
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:153754:53"/>be eaten as Bread; if therefore in the ſame importance only we are to eat his Fleſh, that alſo is to be eaten in a ſpiritual Sence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From theſe words, <hi>v.</hi> 52. <hi>How can this Man give us his Fleſh to eat?</hi> 'tis evident the <hi>Jews</hi> conceived that our <hi>Lord</hi> promiſed to give them his proper Fleſh to eat, and ſwallow down their Throats, as they had done the Bread with which he fed them. And it on all hands is agreed, that they miſtook the ſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s words, and fanſied ſuch a meaning of them as he did not intend; but had our <hi>Lord</hi> intended the <hi>corporeal</hi> eating of his Fleſh and drinking of his Blood, 'tis certain that it muſt be ſwallowed down their Throats, as properly as was the Bread which they had eaten; and therefore no Man who maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this corporeal eating of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Fleſh to be intended here, can, ſuitably to his Opinion, ſay, That they impoſed a falſe ſence upon our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s words, ſince from this ſence it does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably follow, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> intended that his humane Fleſh ſhould properly be eaten; and their words ſignifie no more. Add to this one Conſideration, which ſhews what apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the firſt Three <hi>Centuries</hi> had of this eating of the Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt, viz.</hi> when 'twas objected to them by the <hi>Heathens</hi> that they did <hi>eat Man's Fleſh,</hi> they conſtantly in their <hi>Apologies</hi> reject the accuſation as the vileſt calumny, and as a moſt abominable thing ſufficient to diſcover that the <hi>Author</hi> of ſuch an inſtitution muſt be ſome wicked <hi>Damon,</hi>

            <p n="3">3. The 53. <hi>v.</hi> affords two further Arguments in Refutation of the <hi>corporeal</hi> ſence of theſe Expreſſions, 1. That it follows plainly from it, that the <hi>Thief</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and all the pious and believing <hi>Jews</hi> who heard theſe words, and died before our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Paſſion,<note place="margin">Joh. vi. 4.</note> muſt of neceſſity be damned, for our <hi>Lord</hi> ſaith with an <hi>aſſeveration</hi> to them, <hi>Except you eat the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> now this was ſaid at leaſt above a Year before our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>'s Paſſion, and ſo before the Inſtitution of that Sacrament, in which alone his fleſh could be corporally eaten; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had it been intended of <hi>corporeal</hi> and ſacramental eating, it was impoſſible that any perſon of thoſe Hearers could be ſaved, who died in the enſuing year. 2. Theſe words inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in the corporeal Sence do plainly and inevitably inferr, That they who do deprive the <hi>Laity</hi> all their whole lives of drinking of this blood, expoſe them to inevitable damnation, <hi>Chriſt</hi> having ſaid, <hi>Except you drink the Blood of the Son of Man, you have no Life in you;</hi> for though eating and drinking being taken figuratively, do ſignifie the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> believing in a crucified <hi>Saviour;</hi> yet being taken properly, they cannot be reputed the ſame thing: For albeit they who receive the body only, may be well ſaid to eat the fleſh of <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe they take ſomething by way of Meat into their Mouths, yet cannot they be ſaid to drink his blood, if they take nothing into their Mouths by way of Drink: Since therefore eating and drinking are two diſtinct Actions, ſo that he cannot properly be ſaid to drink, who only eats, ſince the privation of Life is here connected with not drinking of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Blood, as much as with not eating of his fleſh, according to the corporeal Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:153754:55"/>pretation of theſe words, he muſt certainly be deprived of the Life here promiſed, who doth not receive the Cup; becauſe he is deprived of drinking of the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From <hi>Verſ.</hi> 54, 56. the Argument runs thus, whoſeover eateth the Fleſh, and drinketh the Blood of Chriſt in the ſence here ſpoken of, <hi>abideth in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a true and living Member of Chriſt's Body, and he <hi>ſhall have Eternal Life,</hi> and be partaker of an happy <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and ſo no perſon can be either wicked here, or deprived of Everlaſting Life hereafter, who in this ſence here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eats of the Fleſh, and drinketh of the Blood of Chriſt. Now this is very true of eating Spiritually, and by Faith, as it imports believing on <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>40</label> 
               <hi>This,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is the Will of him that ſent me, That every one who believeth on the Son may hve Everelaſting Life; and I will raiſe him up at the lat Day:</hi> but then of Sacramental eating of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Fleſh, it is as falſe; for this was eaten by a <hi>Judas,</hi> and continually is eaten by Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions who are both wicked here, and will be damned hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; this therefore cannot be the import of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s words: and here obſerve, 1. That our Lord ſpeaks in the general, <hi>whoſoever eats.</hi> 2. That he ſpeaks thus, not by way of Promiſe, which might be conditional, but by way of plain Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and declaration of a thing moſt certain. And, 3. That the Text ſhews the eating mentioned here, can never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unprofitably, no not without the greateſt benefit; for 'tis oppoſed to the eating of <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wilderneſs, on this account, that whereas that gave only Temporal Life, this would aſſuredly conferr Eternal; whereas that was not able to preſerve from Temporal, this would preſerve from Death Eternal.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Moreover, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 61, &amp; 62. our Lord ſpeaks thus, <hi>Doth this offend you, what if you ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where he was before: i. e.</hi> are you offended that I thus ſpeak of giving you my Fleh to eat; do you look on this Expreſſion <hi>now</hi> as ſo abſurd and unintelligible, what then will you think of it, when this Body ſhall be removed hence to Heaven? <hi>i. e.</hi> HOw will you then be ſcandalized, and think it ſtill more difficult, and more impoſſible to apprehend how you ſhould eat my Fleſh and drink my Blood, provided you go on to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my words in the groſs carnal Sence.

               <hi>The Body and Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt preſerve thy Soul unto everlaſting Life,</hi> becauſe there was given to the Sick Perſon in a Spoon the Body of our Lord ſteeped in the Holy Blood. The reaſon of this ſteeping we learn from the<note n="(g)" place="margin">Quae ſacra oblatio in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tincta debet eſſe in ſanguine Chriſti, ut veraciter Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poſſit dicere infirmo, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus &amp; ſanguis Domini profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat tibi in vitam aeternam. <hi>De Diſcip.

            </p>
            <p>Now this practice, and the reaſon of the practice here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and approved of, do expreſly ſhew their Faith was this, That the <hi>Prieſt</hi> could not name them both without a Lye, unleſs he gave both; and that they who enjoined that what <hi>Chriſt</hi> had inſtituted to be received ſeparately, ſhould rather be received together, than that either Species ſhould not be received at all, did think both Species neceſſary to a full and entire Communion, as it hath been well noted by <hi>Caſſander.</hi> For to what purpoſe ſhould hey ſo carefully require this intin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if they had then believed that there was nothing wanting to the Grace, or the integrity of the Communion, when they received under one Species alone?</p>
            <p>And though this be abundantly ſufficient to ſhew what was the practice of the Church till the <hi>12th Century,</hi> yet it is eaſie to produce farther evidence of this matter. A <hi>Synod</hi> held in the <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Ticinum,</hi> and therefore ſtiled <hi>Synodus Regio Ticinenſis,</hi> thus Decrees, That<note n="(h)" place="margin">Si is qui infirmatur pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae poenitentiae mancipatus eſt, non poteſt hujus myfterii conſequi medicinam, niſi pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us reconciliatione percepta communionem corporis &amp; <hi>ſanguinis.</hi> Chriſti meruerit. <hi>Concil.

               <hi>Lucas Piſhop</hi> of <hi>Tuy</hi> informs us of an <hi>Heretick,</hi> who being Sick was admoniſhed by his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:153754:60"/>Hoſt <hi>to ſend for a Prieſt, and diſcourſe with him as a Penitent, that he might receive from him,</hi> Sanctiſſimum Sacramentum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris &amp; fanguinis Domini, <hi>the moſt holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</hi> Now all theſe Inſtances do plainly ſhew, that it was far from being a received and <hi>authorized Cuſtom</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to Communicate the Sick under the Species of Bread alone, or to give nothing to them, but one Species only.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, it is extreamly evident from all the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> produced, touching the caſe of <hi>Penitents</hi> and others, that it was a thing eſtabliſhed by the higheſt <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>whole Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that both the holy <hi>Myſteries</hi> ſhould be exhibited to the infirm and dying Perſon. And ſeeing the <hi>Ancients</hi> looked upon it as ſo great a benefit to dying Perſons, to be refreſhed with the food of the Body and the Blood of Chriſt, ſince they took ſo much care to give the Bread ſteeped in the conſecrated Wine to them, who, through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of Body, could not ſallow it down dry, and to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter each Species apart to them who were not extream ill; ſince, as<note n="(l)" place="margin">De Diſcipl. eccleſ. l. 1. c. 195.</note> 
               <hi>Regino</hi> doth inform us, they determined, that great care was to be taken, leaſt the doing this being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd too long, it ſhould prove to the deſtruction of the Soul, our <hi>Lord</hi> having ſaid, unleſs you eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man and drink his Blood, you ſhall have no life in you. I ſay, from all theſe things it is extreamly evident, that it was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceied, and in ſubjects capable, was deemed a neceſſary thing to communicate the infirm and dying perſon under both Species of Bread and Wine.</p>
            <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">§ 6.</note> that Children alſo, if capable of doing ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in both kinds, will be evident againſt the precarious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of <hi>J.L.</hi> 1. From the clear Teſtimony of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Book <hi>De Lapſis,</hi> for there he introduceth the Children who by their Parents were carried to eat things offered to <hi>Idols,</hi> or to offer to them, thus pleading of their Cauſe to God,<note n="(m)" place="margin">Nos nihil fecimus, nec derelicto cibo &amp; poculo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, ad profana contagia ſponte properavimus, perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit nos aliena perfidia, paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſenfimus parricidas, <hi>p.</hi> 125.</note>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:153754:60"/>ordinarily received both the Elements; for had they not, as many as were capable, received the Bread, as well as the Cup, why doth he introduce them purging themſelves from the neglect of both? Why doth he make them, with as much care, to plead, <hi>We did not leave the meat,</hi> as we left not <hi>the Cup of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewed the cuſtom of this Age, I ſhall conſider what is, from St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſuggeſted to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that he relates, That <hi>the ſolemnities being ended, the Deacon who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Holy Cup to the Faithful, being to give it to a Child,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 67.</note> 
               <hi>ſhe turned away her face, as not able to ſupport ſo great Majeſty; ſhe ſhut her Mouth, and refuſed the Chalice, and when the Deacon had forced ſome of it into her Mouth, ſhe could not retain it in thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Entrails, ſo great was the power and Majeſty of our Lord.</hi> Whence it is argued, that ſhe received the Cup only.

This being ſo, the Bread might be given to the <hi>Mother</hi> for the Child to eat at leaſure, and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> take no notice of her refuſal to receive it; but then, becauſe the Cup was by the <hi>Deacon</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived again into his hands to be diſtributed to otehrs, he muſt ſtay till the Child had participated, and ſo he muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make it drink of it.

            <p>And here let it be noted, that not the latter <hi>Grecians</hi> only, but the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> did generally hold that this was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be done, by virtue of that Precept, <hi>Except you eat my Fleſh and drink my Blood, you ſhall have no Life in you,</hi> from whence it is extreamly evident, that neither in the Fifth Age, when Infants were by virtue of this Text admitted to the Sacrament; nor in the following Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> could it be an eſtabliſhed Cuſtom, to give to Children the Cup only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That neither <hi>Leo</hi> nor <hi>Gelaſius</hi> gave any <hi>new Precept to the Church</hi> touching this Matter,<note place="margin">§. 7. Chap. 5. §. 2.</note> is partly evident from what hath been already ſaid, nor are there any Footſteps of this new imaginary Law to be found in their <hi>Decrees:</hi> For the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:153754:63"/>words of <hi>Leo</hi> only command, That when the sacrilegious diſſembling of the <hi>Manichees</hi> was diſcovered, <hi>they ſhould be driven by the Prieſts Authority from the Society of the Saints.</hi> And the words of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> do only ſay, That <hi>they, who, in the Region of</hi> Squillaci, <hi>were bound up by a Superſtition unknown to him, from receiving the Cup, ſhould either receive the whole sacrament, or be kept back from the whole.</hi> Where now, I pray you, is any appearance of this new pretended <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Firſt Eccleſiaſtical Precept,</hi> That <hi>all the Faithful ſhould from henceforth be obliged to receive under both Species,</hi> unleſs thoſe words of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> import, that the Receiving of the Bread without the Cup is not Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>entire Sacrament;</hi> or, unleſs his following Reaſon, That <hi>the diviſion of one and the ſame Myſtery cannot happen without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege,</hi> be a general Rule concerning all the Faithful?</p>
            <p>But to diſpute no longer in a caſe ſo plain, both <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> ſufficiently inform us of the practice of their times; for <hi>Leo</hi> doth not only ſay, That<note n="(o)" place="margin">De paſſ. domini Serm. 14. p. 284.</note>

               <hi>our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is decided, for in the sacred Ceremony of the Lord's Supper, we have ſeen that the Church hath always believed and taught for a Thouſand years and upwards, that the Laity by divine Precept, and for the ends forementioned, were obliged to receive both Species, that the Fathers exhorted them to do ſo, and did, both by expreſs
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153754:64"/>Declarations, and by many Cuſtoms and determinations, ſufficiently condemn the contrary Practice, when any Hereticks or Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Perſons did decline the Cup. That they did generally ſo Interpret our Saviour's Inſtitution, that it as well concerned the Laity as Clergy, and with one voice aſſerted it was not lawful to vary from it, or celebrate the Mystery otherwiſe than it was delivered by Christ and his Apostles, and practiſed in the Primitive Church. Behold what has been always practiſed, behold what ought to ſtand for a Law, in oppoſition to all the Definitions of the Councils of</hi> Conſtance, Baſil, Trent, <hi>and all their</hi> Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante<hi>'s to our Lord's Institution, and to the Practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church.</hi>
